   <h3>
     <p>
       So most of you will know judging by the name of my YouTube channel that my name is Luca.
     </p>
     <p>
       Anyway, so I am a chinese boy and raised in Canada. My life is full of technologie because my dad is an engineer.
     </p>
     <p>
       My hobbies are tennis, learning, technologie, coding, gaming (Minecraft and Geometry Dash)
       <p>
         math and a lot other.
       </p>
     </p>
       I'm very socialised and have a lot of friends to hang out and/or chat, text and talk.
     </p>
     <p>
        I love walking in my neighborhood and mess around a bit, just having fun outside.
     </p>
     <p>
        I do take school very seriously as this YouTude community can just become shit and flop over, and if that happens.
     </p>
     <p>
        I'll need a new job. So I get an education just in case.
     </p>
     <p>
       I live with my parents (mom and dad), I have a little brother and also have my grandpa who lives with us.
     </p>
     <p>
        Our family is big all because of the "Baby boom".
     </p>
     <p>
        (if your asking what the hell is baby Boom, ask your parenrts or search it up since I have no time to explain on this).
     </p>
     <p>
       I have a fear of creepy shits online, like Slenderman, you know, those fake creepypasta,
     </p>
     <p>
        but still, they give me the shit of hell of fear.
     </p>
     <p>
        I have a little fear of high, the common old school thing. I have a phobia of spider aka arachnophobia.
</p>
<p>
           I normally record in my basement because the heat is unsupportable for me. I will record in my childish bedroom when its winter.
         </p>
         <p>
           I normally use to record with DarkLightBoy, but something happened and caused me to block him everywhere on social media
         </p>
         <p>
           I love being in calls with my friends, I normally call FlooberGaming and his gang.
         </p>
         <p>
            They are mostly about my age and we understand eachother a lot. FloodberGaming is a really cool guy even if he is most possibly younger than me.
            <p>
              His crew members are: FlooberGaming himself, JFK145, QualityCreepy, Dum Studios. They also have a YouTube channel so go check it out (if you are gamers obviously).
